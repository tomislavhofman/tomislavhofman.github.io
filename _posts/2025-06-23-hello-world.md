This is my first blog post! In this post, I’ll show you how easy it is to print **Hello, World!** using Kotlin, even if you’re running the code right in your browser. Kotlin is a modern, expressive language that’s great for beginners and experienced developers alike. Below, you’ll find a simple example you can try out yourself. This post and the code example were generated using GitHub Copilot.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```
